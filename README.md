# Docklight
## Metrics made easy

**Docklight** is a container metrics monitoring solution that makes organizing, monitoring, and visualizing your metrics easy. The Docklight GUI interface is clean, easy to understand, and provides you with all of the information you need to manage and monitor your Docker containers outside of the Docker Desktop.

# How does it work?

After installing **Docklight**, you can run it natively on your localhost. The application will speak to your Docker Daemon and provide you with real-time, live-streamed data in charts that update as your data changes.

## Get a micro and macro view of your data

With **Docklight**, you can see an overall average of your data in addition to tracking the metrics of your individual containers. You also have the option of viewing your containers sorted by active and inactive, and starting and stopping them with the click of a button from within the GUI. 

# How to get **Docklight**

First:

```
git clone https://github.com/oslabs-beta/Docklight.git
```

Clone our repository onto your local machine. 

Next: 

```
npm install
```

Install any dependencies you might need to run this repo. 

**Make sure your Docker Desktop app is running before this next step. Otherwise, Docklight won't be able to reach your Daemon!**

Please also keep in mind that Docklight uses ports **8080** and **3000**.

Finally:

```
npm run dev
```

Run our application and view your data!
